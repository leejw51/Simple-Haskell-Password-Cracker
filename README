What's This?
============

This is just a small toy password cracker to learn how to do parallelization in haskell.
You pass it the sha1sum of the password you're trying to crack and it uses parallelization to brute force it.
It's not very good and it doesn't even crack salted passwords but it demonstrates how to do parallelization.
